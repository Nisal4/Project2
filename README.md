# Project 2 (Money Minder)

Welcome to the Money Minder budgeting app. 

The Money Minder app allows you to create multiple budgets and track all of your expenses. The app is broken down into the budgets that users create and a number of predetermined categories that you can log your input under. The app allows for full CRUD functionality; all additions to a budget are editable and deletable.
